        <p>
          True, As much as CS50<span>X</span> is one of the greatest computer
          science courses ever (probably the greatest in my opinion) you might
          want to know why it lives up to its reputation.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          CS50<span><u>X</u></span> Is the introduction to the intellectual
          enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This
          course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve
          problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data
          structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software
          engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL
          plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts,
          humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a
          final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike,
          with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50
          students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of
          this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters,
          without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience,
          accessible to all students, and build community among students.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          CS50<span>X</span> helps you understand a lot of the core CS concepts,
          and then gives you the confidence to build cool projects. It is very
          difficult and fast-paced, but if you stick with it, I think it will
          pay off. When I try to explain it to bootcamp students it is hard to
          articulate why it's important to start in C and learn core CS
          concepts. Maybe I just want it to be valuable because I took it and
          liked it. The real reason is probably because neither of us are far
          enough along to really know what is the best way.

          CS50 is fantastic. I read that it is the single most popular course at
          Harvard. People who aren’t even CS majors sign up to take the course.
          On campus, they have tshirts, free food, a hackathon, etc. You don’t
          get any of that on edX, but you do get the following: a great IDE
          developed by CS50 TAs, a community of support on reddit,
          stackoverflow, facebook, twitter, etc., debugging tool (debug50), and
          a tool to immediately check if your pset solution is correct
          (check50). There is even a little fun CS50 tv show with little 2 min
          episodes after each lecture. I could go on. You don’t have to take
          notes on the lectures because there’s a webpage that has all the
          notes. There are short videos done by TAs explaining some of the
          concepts in more detail. There are walkthroughs that help you set up
          the pset solutions.

            <div class="answer hidden">
              <p>
                In some earlier problem sets, you’ll have a choice between a
                “less comfortable” and a “more comfortable” problem. The “less
                comfortable” are what you might consider the “standard” version
                of the problem, designed for students who have little or no
                prior experience. The “more comfortable” are the “challenge”
                version, designed for students who consider themselves more
                comfortable due to prior study/experience before this class. As
                such, they may require more concepts than have been covered in
                the course so far.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                If you find yourself really struggling with the “more
                comfortable” version, you should switch to the “less” version
                (or if you’ve already completed that, simply move on and perhaps
                revisit in a later week). It would be better for you to skip the
                problem than to become so frustrated as to drop out of the
                course entirely. For reference, in the Fall 2019 Harvard class,
                only 20-30% of students submitted the “more comfortable”
                problems. You don’t get any extra points for doing the “more
                comfortable” problems. If you submit both, the one with the
                highest grade will count towards your overall course progress.

                CS50x is a course that spans multiple years, but has a content

                reflect your completion status of the current version of the
                course (which is now CS50x 2022), even if you have completed the

                still available at certificates.cs50.io, and eligibility for a
                Verified Certificate is unaffected so long as you saw the green

                No, your verification should be good for an entire year, but if
                it has expired, you should be able to re-verify yourself via
                edX’s dashboard.

                Once you have completed the course and met all of the
                requirements, you’ll see a link on your CS50x Gradebook page
                allowing you to request a free CS50 Certificate, much like the
                one shown here. This link will be available within approximately
                four hours, and you should then proceed to log in using your
                GitHub credentials. If you have trouble accessing it, try
                logging out of GitHub and back in, then revisit the link to
                download your certificate. Be sure to request your certificate
                before 1 January 2023.

                Every few weeks, CS50’s staff provides edX with a list of
                students who have satisfied CS50x’s requirements (by receiving
                scores of at least 70% on every required problem submitted as
                part of the course’s ten problem sets, the eight labs, as well
                as on the final project). Typically within a week thereafter,
                edX then generates students’ Verified Certificates (for students
                who have active Verification), at which point they should appear
                automatically on edX’s dashboard. Note that edX will not notify
                you, so be sure to check your dashboard periodically.

                Your CS50x Gradebook shows the scores for each 2022 problem
                submission and progress you have made for each week. When you

                A verified certificate, which you can purchase from edX, “can
                provide proof for an employer, school, or other institution that
                you have successfully completed an online course.” A CS50
                Certificate is a free certificate from CS50 itself.

                On 1 January 2023, the course will be updated to a 2023 version.

                Yes, any progress you made on past years’ problem sets has been
                carried forward to your CS50x 2022 gradebook. Note that
                individual problem scores from past years are not shown, but if
                the corresponding problem set and lab was completed, you’ll see
                it marked with a green circle and included in your progress bar
                at the top. Moving forward, though, you must submit CS50x 2022’s
                problem sets and labs.

                CS50x does not have individual deadlines for assignments. You
                are welcome to work on and submit at your own pace. The overall
                deadline for the course is end of day, Eastern time, on 31
                December 2022 (Saturday, December 31, 2022, 11:59 PM EST). For
                your convenience, we will often on this website render this time
                in your local timezone (Sunday, January 1, 2023 at 5:59 AM
                GMT+1). If all required work is turned in before the above time,
                and ultimately receives a satisfactory grade (whether before or
                shortly after that deadline), you will be considered to have
                completed CS50x.
