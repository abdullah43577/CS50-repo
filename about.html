          <u>CS50</u><span>X</span>
        </h2>
        <p>
          True, As much as CS50<span>X</span> is one of the greatest computer
          science courses ever (probably the greatest in my opinion) you might
          want to know why it lives up to its reputation.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          CS50<span><u>X</u></span> Is the introduction to the intellectual
          enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This
          course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve
          problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data
          structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software
          engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL
          plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts,
          humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a
          final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike,
          with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50
          students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of
          this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters,
          without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience,
          accessible to all students, and build community among students.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          CS50<span>X</span> helps you understand a lot of the core CS concepts,
          and then gives you the confidence to build cool projects. It is very
          difficult and fast-paced, but if you stick with it, I think it will
          pay off. When I try to explain it to bootcamp students it is hard to
          articulate why it's important to start in C and learn core CS
          concepts. Maybe I just want it to be valuable because I took it and
          liked it. The real reason is probably because neither of us are far
          enough along to really know what is the best way.
        </p>

        <p>
          CS50 is fantastic. I read that it is the single most popular course at
          Harvard. People who aren’t even CS majors sign up to take the course.
          On campus, they have tshirts, free food, a hackathon, etc. You don’t
          get any of that on edX, but you do get the following: a great IDE
          developed by CS50 TAs, a community of support on reddit,
          stackoverflow, facebook, twitter, etc., debugging tool (debug50), and
          a tool to immediately check if your pset solution is correct
          (check50). There is even a little fun CS50 tv show with little 2 min
          episodes after each lecture. I could go on. You don’t have to take
          notes on the lectures because there’s a webpage that has all the
          notes. There are short videos done by TAs explaining some of the
          concepts in more detail. There are walkthroughs that help you set up
          the pset solutions.
