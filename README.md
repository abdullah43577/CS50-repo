## About

This was my Week 8 project Assignment given to me while taking the CS50 Course. I was told to build a website with 3 pages or more, so I decided to build a website talking about how great CS50 is itself. I am fully open to reviews about this.

If there's any way you feel I could improve this, please do let me know.
